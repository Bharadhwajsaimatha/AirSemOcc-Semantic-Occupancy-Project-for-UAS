## News

- **2024-12-01**: The work is presented as a part of master thesis colloquium at Technische Hochschule Deggendorf, Germany.
- **2025-03-01**: The paper will be submitted for review at ICCV 2025. The dataset will be released soon.

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for the paper "AirSemOcc: Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion for UAS Navigation"(To be released soon) by Sai Bharadhwaj Matha. The paper will be submitted to International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025. This work is done at the Fraunhofer IVI, Institute of Transportation Systems, Ingolstadt, Germany as a part of my Master thesis. The authority to publish the dataset is owned by Fraunhofer IVI.

The dataset is generated using the following tools:

1. 3D Reconstruction tools like [COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io/) and [AgiSoft Metashape](https://www.agisoft.com/).
2. In-house semantic segmentation models.
3. 3D point cloud processing tools like [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org/).

## Installation

To be updated soon.

## Dataset

The dataset will be released soon.
